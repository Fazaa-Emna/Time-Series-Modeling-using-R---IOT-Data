## **Introduction**

As part of an initiative to transform our city into a smart city, the government is focusing on enhancing service efficiency through digital and intelligent solutions. A critical area of improvement is traffic management. Efficient traffic flow is vital for reducing congestion, minimizing delays, and improving the overall quality of life for citizens.

To address this, we are developing a robust traffic prediction system by analyzing traffic patterns at four key junctions in the city. Traffic patterns vary significantly between normal working days, holidays, and special occasions, making accurate forecasting essential for infrastructure planning and managing traffic peaks.

## **Business Understanding**

The primary objective of this project is to predict traffic patterns at the four selected junctions for the next four months. We are working with historical data spanning 20 months, collected from sensors at various intervals and periods. This variability presents a challenge in creating accurate forecasts, especially for junctions with sparse or limited data.

By developing a reliable traffic prediction algorithm, we aim to provide valuable insights to the government, aiding in informed decision-making and contributing to the larger goal of a smarter, more efficient city.
